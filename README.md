## Description
Browser Reloader is a CLI tool that automatically reloads your browser when you make changes to your code. It's particularly useful for web development projects that use template engines. The tool uses chokidar to watch directories for changes, and socket.io to communicate with the browser.



Features:

* Reload your browser on every code change.
* Watch multiple directories and reload multiple hosts.
* Reload another computer's browser with this tool (the other computer must be connected to the same network).



## Installation: Command Line Tools
You can install Browser Reloader locally or globally using npm.

Locally:
```bash
npm i browser-reloader
```

Globally:
```bash
npm i -g browser-reloader
```
